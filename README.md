# Will Neal's Web Development Portfolio

## The page

This portfolio is based around a simple two tone color scheme of cream and light blue. The images have rounded edges to give the entire page a warm and slightly vintage feel. The page was designed to be simple and uncluttered while also being friendly and inviting. To this end I made my about section conversational and warm. I want viewers of the page to know that in addition to my technical skills, I can cultivate a feeling. 

## Features

The links in the navigation bars take you to the indicated sections. The email in the contacts section can be clicked on and will autopopulate the users default email client with my email address. Similarly the GitHub link will take you to my GitHub profile page. The project images increase in size when they are hovered over and also assume a grey shadow behind them to give the appearance of moving closer to the viewer and floating. When the width of the page goes below 768px the images and contact info become arranged horizontally while the page heading and navigation bar are centered. This creates a smooth vertical scrolling experience when on mobile.
